      <p>I am a new student at <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/"
        target="_blank">Lambda School</a>, starting
        an intense program of <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/courses/full-stack-web-development"

      <p>What brings me to this point? This site will allow me
      to explore my "why" -- the source of my motivation, curiousity, and purpose.</p>

      <h2>Meet Mr. Unpredictable</h2>
      <p>My husband, Dan, was an incredible computer science genius.
        He loved computers and technology, especially data science. He once
        told me jokingly that I could call him Mr. Unpredictable because he always
        learning new things and going on adventures. The one thing
        we never would have predicted was his brain tumor and his unexpected death
        shortly after surgery earlier this year.

        <h3>Computer Geeks Unite</h3>
        <p>I've always been interested in science, in many aspects, such as molecular
        biology, chemistry, and computer programming. I met Dan while we both
        attended the Advanced High School Studies Program at Brigham Young
        University, during the summer before our senior year of High School.
        It was an intense 2-week program, learning Prolog. We both graduated with
        honors and planned to write each other.</p>

        <p>We both attended BYU for our undergraduate degrees. I majored in
          microbiology. I worked at a lab following graduation, and later
          enjoyed many opportunities to volunteer in our community. I started
          studying computer programming on my own, by taking courses through
          Coursera, Udacity, etc. Dan always encouraged me to learn and to push
          myself. He even had me use Linux instead of Windows, as a growing
          experience.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>I always will admire Dan's work ethic, his drive to continually improve
          his skills and his knowledge. While he was alive, he was a great source of
          help, encouragement, and advice. Now that he's gone, I'm more on my own
          to figure things out. How should I back up my data? What's the best
          way to write a recursive function? Before, I could ask him. Now I'm
          learning to be more independent and find out things more on my own.
          </p>

          <p>I hope that I can honor his memory. I dedicate myself to carry on with
            the pursuit of learning to strive to become the type of computer
            programmer that he was, and to help others with my
              skills and knowledge.</p>
